# Hi, I'm Walter :wave:

Unity developer, tinkerer and teacher – building tools and small experiments to make game development smoother and more fun.

## About me

- Focused on **Unity3D** gameplay and tooling.
- Enjoy creating **reusable utilities** that solve common problems once and for all.
- Passionate about **learning by doing** and sharing that knowledge with others.

## :toolbox: Featured projects

### :dart: ConeCast

A small but widely used **Unity3D extension** that adds a `ConeCastAll` method to the `Physics` class, similar to `Physics.SphereCastAll`, to find colliders within a cone‑shaped volume.
Perfect for things like vision cones, field‑of‑view checks, and cone‑based abilities.

- Written in **C#** and distributed under the **MIT license**.
- Used and referenced by other developers in tutorials, discussions and YouTube projects.

### :test_tube: Experiments & learning repos

- `ml-scratch-2020` – machine learning experiments and learning projects.  
- `first-order-model` – fork of a motion‑model project for image animation.
- `ARWT` fork – exploring web‑based AR via Unity bridges to browser AR libraries.

These repositories are mostly **playgrounds for learning**, prototyping and trying out new ideas.

## :seedling: What I'm into

- **Game feel & gameplay tools** in Unity (aim‑assist, detection volumes, etc.). 
- **AR & experimental interfaces**, especially web‑based AR from Unity.
- **Sharing small utilities** that other devs can drop into their own projects.

## :mailbox: Get in touch

- GitHub: [@walterellisfun](https://github.com/walterellisfun)
- Open to collaboration on **Unity tools, AR prototypes, and small game experiments**.
